## **2.2.1 Overview**

This document outlines the testing phase of our virtual pet game, which was designed and implemented in Java. The game allows players to care for a digital pet by managing its hunger, happiness, health, and sleep. The testing process was crucial to ensure the stability, functionality, and usability of the application before final deployment.

The project has successfully completed the implementation phase, with the core game mechanics and graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java and Java Swing. To ensure the quality and reliability of the codebase, we employed rigorous testing methodologies, primarily utilizing JUnit for unit testing. Additionally, Maven was integrated into the development pipeline to streamline dependency management and test execution.

Our testing strategy consisted of the following methodologies:

* **Unit Testing:** JUnit was used to test individual components, including pet behavior logic, state transitions, and interaction handling.  
* **Integration Testing:** Ensured that different modules (such as the pet's state management and GUI interactions) worked seamlessly together.  
* **ValidationTesting:** Assessed core features such as feeding, playing, resting, and the effects of neglecting the pet over time.  
* **System Testing:** Assessed the program when run as a whole

## 

## **2.2.2 Objectives**

The main objectives of the testing phase were:

* **Ensure code correctness** by validating pet behavior logic and game mechanics.  
* **Verify integration** between game logic and the graphical user interface.  
* **Test user interactions** to confirm smooth gameplay and UI responsiveness.  
* **Identify and fix bugs** to improve overall game stability.  
* **Ensure performance efficiency** so that the game runs smoothly under different conditions.  
* **Validate functional requirements** by confirming that all core game features work as intended.  
* **Prevent regression issues** by ensuring new changes do not introduce unexpected bugs.

| **Test Category:** | *Integration test* |
| **Requirement:** | *3.1.7 Commands The player interacts with the pet by issuing commands. The commands available are dependent on the petâ€™s state (see requirement 3.1.6). b) Feed: The pet is fed food, and their fullness value increases (they are less hungry). The player should be able to select from different food types each with their own properties (e.g., some might add more to the fullness value than others). The food available should be based on the playerâ€™s inventory (see requirement 3.1.8).  c) Give Gift: The pet is given a gift by the player and their happiness value increases. The player should be able to select from different gift types each with their own properties (e.g., some might add more happiness than others). The gifts available should be based on the playerâ€™s inventory (see requirement 3.1.8).  d) Take to the Vet: The player takes the pet to the vet and the petâ€™s health is increased by a set amount.

| **Test Results:** | *Item and pet stats updated properly upon usage (or lack thereof)* |
| **Remarks:** | Requirement d) was expanded upon, giving healing items as well as the option for the vet |

For integration testing, we followed a **Bottom-Up Integration** approach. We first implemented and tested in-game features such as pet commands, inventory management, the shop system, and interactions with the pet. After confirming their functionality, we worked backward to integrate higher-level components such as the pet selection screen and main menu. To facilitate this process, we used simple driver classes that supplied hand-crafted pet and player data, ensuring that lower-level modules functioned correctly before integrating them into the broader system. 

## **Validation testing**

In this testing, requirements established as part of requirements modelling are validated against the software has been constructed.

| Test Case Name: | *User Interface*  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Test Case Description:** | *An easy to navigate Graphical User Interface (GUI), largely mouse based, should inform players about the petâ€™s state, and respond to the userâ€™s inputs.* |

| **Pre-Requisites:** | *All GUIs must be implemented* |
| **Expected Results:** | *The buttons lead to the correlating screens* |
| **Test Category:** | *Validation test* |
| **Requirement:** | *3.1.1 User Interface Your application needs to provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that players of the intended age group can navigate easily. This interface should be at least partly mouse based, inform players about the petâ€™s state, and respond to the userâ€™s inputs. The following UI requirements must be included: Multiple Screens: The game must have at least five distinct screens/pages including: a main menu screen (requirement 3.1.2), a gameplay screen, an instructional/tutorial screen (requirement 3.1.3), a load game / new game screen (requirement 3.1.4), and a parental controls screen (requirement 3.1.11). Your team is free to add additional screens as required. Mouse-Based Interaction: The interface must support mouse-based interactions, enabling users to navigate through the game's screens, make selections, and control game elements primarily with a mouse (e.g., click a button that feeds the pet, etc.). Keyboard Shortcuts and Commands: The interface should include keyboard shortcuts and commands for common actions to facilitate ease of use, especially for power users or when a mouse is not the most efficient input method or for accessibility reasons. Where relevant, include keyboard controls for gameplay actions (e.g., pressing 'P' to pause, â€˜Fâ€™ to feed, â€˜Gâ€™ to give a gift, 'Esc' to return to the main menu, etc.). Feedback Systems: The UI must provide visual or auditory feedback in response to user actions, such as clicking buttons or entering commands, to confirm that the desired action has been taken.  3.1.2 Main Menu Your game must have a main menu screen that displays the title of your game and provides options for the user to select from. These options must include 1\) start a new game, 2\) load a previously saved game, 3\) tutorial or instructions, 4\) parental controls, 6\) exit. Your team may add additional options. Each option should take the player to a new screen in your application. The main menu should also display: 1\) some graphic or visual that is representative of your game, 2\) list the names of the developerâ€™s who created it (this would be the members of your team), 3\) your teamâ€™s number, 4\) term it was created in (e.g. â€œFall 2024), and 5\) mention that this was created as part of CS2212 at Western University.  3.1.3 Instructions and/or Tutorials You must include at least one screen with detailed instructions on how to play your game and use this application. This can be text based, include pictures, or be an interactive tutorial. In all cases it must be comprehensive enough to inform players with no previous experience with your software, how to play your game. It should document all major features from the players perspective (i.e. it does need to include low level technical details). When creating your instructions or tutorial, you should keep in mind the target demographic for your game and write these instructions appropriately for their age level.*  |
| **Automation:** | *Manual* |
| **Date Run:** | *03/28/2025 3:00PM* |
| **Pass/Fail:** | *Pass* |
| **Test Results:** | *Menus are consistent, main menu buttons work, main menu has the image and the info at the bottom, and the info screen has the basic info suited for the target demographic* |
| **Remarks:** | None |

| Test Case Name: | *New pets, save/load* |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Test Case Description:** | *The pet selection as well as the save/load system should work* |
| **Test Steps:** | *Make a new pet At least 3 options should be available Modify the pet (feed, let the stats decay, etc) Close the game & exit to the main menu (two separate tests) Load and check whether the stats match The user should be able to load any of their pets* |
| **Pre-Requisites:** | *All menus are implemented* |
| **Expected Results:** | *The pet stats should persist between sessions, and the user should be able to create a new pet* |
| **Test Category:** | *Validation test* |
| **Requirement:** | *3.1.4 New Game & Pet Selection When a new game is selected, the player is presented with a choice of picking from at least 3 different virtual pet types. An image representing each pet type should be displayed on the screen and well as some basic information about each pet type. The user should be able to select one of the pets and give it a name. Once named, a new save file (see requirement 3.1.5) is created, and the user is brought to the main game screen. Each pet should have slightly different characteristics that impact gameplay. For example, one pet might become hungry faster than the others, another might require less gifts to stay happy, and so on. The characteristics of each pet are up to your team, but they should be noticeably different in terms of game paly and described to the player when selecting a pet. As mentioned, each pet should be represented by an image. The image should match up with the sprite2 used to represent the pet in the game. Your team is not required to create their own images, and it is acceptable to use premade sprites found online so long as you credit where they were obtained from.  3.1.5 Save/Load Game State It is important to provide players with the ability to save their progress and the current state of their pet and inventory (requirement 3.1.8). To achieve this, the game must feature a Save Game State mechanism that specifically captures the player's progression and the current state of the pet. This should include any vital statistics about the pet, the type of pet being used, the petâ€™s name, their current health, hunger, the current score, and the playerâ€™s inventory, etc. The primary goal is to enable players to resume their progression from their last play session. To facilitate this, you can either automatically save progress after set check points or provide players with a manual save option that is easily accessible somewhere in the GUI. When restarting the game, players should have the capability to load their previously saved state. This loading process should load the pet back into the same state it was in when the game was last saved. A clear confirmation message should be displayed each time the game state is saved, reassuring players that their progress has been successfully recorded. Your Save/Load system must be designed in such as way that a player can have multiple pets that they can switch between by saving and then loading a new pet. You may either have the player select a file that contains the save state to load or have a set number of save slots for the user to choose from (at least 3).*  |

| **Pre-Requisites:** | *The inventory, store, and pet interaction window should be finished* |
| **Expected Results:** | *The player should be able to acquire and use items* |
| **Test Category:** | *Validation test* |
| **Requirement:** | *3.1.8 Player Inventory The game should keep track of and display the playerâ€™s current inventory of items. Items fall into two categories: a) Food Items: This category of items increases the petâ€™s fullness value (making them less hungry). Each food item should have different properties and increases the fullness value by a different amount. b) Gift Items: This category of items increases the petâ€™s happiness level. Each gift item should have a different property and increase the happiness level by a different amount. The game should have a minimum of three items from each category. The inventory should display a list of the items currently in the playerâ€™s inventory including a count of how many they have of each item type. This can be a text-based listing or displayed pictorially (e.g. with icons). The inventory can be its own screen in the application or part of the gameplay screen. Using the Give Gift and Feed commands (from requirement 3.1.7) should lower the amount of that item in the inventory. The game should include a mechanic that allows the player to obtain items. This can be as simple as giving the player items periodically after a set amount of time, rewarding them with items at set score levels (requirement 3.1.9), or as complex as requiring them to complete a minigame first. The details of the mechanic are up to your team, but there must be a way of obtaining items. The players inventory should be saved as per requirement 3.1.5. 3.1.9 Keeping Score The game should keep track of the playerâ€™s score. The score should start at zero and increase when the player does a positive action such as feeding the pet, giving it a gift, or playing with it. Some actions may also reduce the score, such as subtracting points if the pet had to be taken to the vet. The exact details of what adds and subtracts score, or how much is up to your team but should be clearly documented. The current score should be displayed on the game play screen and saved in the save file as per requirement 3.1.5. 3.1.13 One Extra Functional Requirement  Add more items, currency, and an item store.*  |

| **Requirement:** | *3.1.11 Parental Controls The game should provide a separate area accessible via the main menu (requirement 3.1.2 Main Menu) that provides controls and statistics for the parent of the player. This screen should be password protected to prevent the player from accessing it. You may have a hardcoded password or pin; user accounts are not required. Parent users are also allowed to play the game as a player would and can perform all tasks a player can.* |
| **Automation:** | *Manual* |
| **Date Run:** | *03/28/2025 3:00PM* |
| **Pass/Fail:** | *Pass* |
| **Test Results:** | *The parent can view the statistics, reset them, and set a new password as well as play as a regular player. They can also revive the pet* |
| **Remarks:** | None |

| Test Case Name: | *Housekeeping, non-functional requirements* |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Test Case Description:** | *Various other miscellaneous features* |
| **Test Steps:** | *Exit the program Check whether the data saves properly  Try invalid input Try to get to the main menu at all stages Non-functional requirements: Must work in Java 23 Object-oriented approach Check offensive content GUI No internet connection required, store local data Only freely available dependencies and libraries Check to see if itâ€™s all in GitLab Check if comments are commented with Javadoc Check if JUnit 5 tests are used Check to see if it modifies files it does not create Error messages must be shown The entire project just be under 500 megabytes Check if it runs smoothie*  |
| **Pre-Requisites:** | *All features implemented* |
| **Expected Results:** | *The player should be able to acquire and use items* |
| **Test Category:** | *Validation test* |
| **Requirement:** | *3.1.12 Housekeeping & Error Handling Your application also needs to do basic housekeeping things that are part of any decently put together application. For example, the user must be able to exit your application cleanly and data must be saved correctly on exit such that it is available the next time the application is started (e.g. save states should be persistent, parental statistics should not be lost, and so on). If you allow the user to minimize or maximize the window, UI elements should scale correctly. It is ok if you disable this and do not allow the user to minimize or maximize the window. You may also force the game to be full screen or a set window size. Any errors that could be raised by your application should be handled and clear messages in simple English should be shown to the user, that may help them understand and correct the error. Ideally, your application should avoid crashing without explanation. Any user input that could potentially be incorrect or cause faults in your software, must be validated and checked for errors. There must always be a way to navigate between the screens of the application. The user should never get stuck on a screen with no way back to the main menu. You may add other housekeeping functions as you see fit to help support your application. How you choose to make these available to the user is up to you.  All of 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements* |
| **Automation:** | *Manual* |
| **Date Run:** | *03/28/2025 3:00PM* |
| **Pass/Fail:** | *Pass* |
